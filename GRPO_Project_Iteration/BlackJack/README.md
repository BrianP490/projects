# üÉè Blackjack Agent Project

## Project Overview
This project is a Streamlit-based Blackjack Agent that uses PyTorch to load a trained model and make decisions in a simplified Blackjack game. The app allows users to input the game state (player's hand sum, dealer's visible card, usable ace) and get the agent's recommended action (hit or stick).

## Features
- Interactive UI built with Streamlit
- Loads a trained PyTorch model
- Accepts user input for game state
- Outputs the agent's recommended action
- Lightweight and easy to deploy
